## 📋 Project Description

A portal for allocating small contributions to multiple causes, aggregating total donations per cause, and visualizing impact via summary charts. The project uses secure payment-gateway stubs, transactional database operations, and dashboarding components.

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Micro-Donation Platform project, developed as part of the UE23CS341A course at PES University.

## 🔔 Recent changes (added features)

The backend donation flow was enhanced to better record and track donation events. Changes added in this update:

- Donation submission endpoint improvements
   - POST `/api/donate/` now accepts `causeId` and `amount` (required).
   - Optional `paymentId` and `paymentMethod` can be provided; a `paymentId` will be generated when omitted.
   - The endpoint validates cause status and end date before accepting donations.

- Donation metadata recorded
   - User donation entries now include `causeId` (reference), `paymentId`, `paymentMethod`, and `status` (pending/completed/failed) while keeping the human-readable `cause` name for backwards compatibility.

- Cause updates
   - A successful donation increments the cause's `currentAmount` and `donorCount` and updates the cause `status` to `completed` if the target is reached.

- Backwards compatible storage
   - Existing `donations` subdocuments on `User` remain usable; new payment fields were added in a compatible fashion.

These changes prepare the backend for later integration with a real payment gateway and improved reporting/receipts.

## 🔧 Story 5.2 — Implemented Structured Logging

As part of Story 5.2 we implemented structured, consistent logging across the backend service using Pino. This improves debuggability and enables easier ingestion into log management systems.

What was added:

- Added dependencies: `pino`, `pino-http` (configured in `src/backend/package.json`).
- New logger utility: `src/backend/utils/logger.js` which exports a `logger` and `httpLogger` middleware.
- The Express server (`src/backend/server.js`) now uses the structured HTTP logger middleware to attach `req.log` for request-scoped logs.
- Replaced ad-hoc console statements with structured logs in:
   - `src/backend/middleware/errorHandler.js`
   - `src/backend/routes/authRoutes.js`
   - `src/backend/utils/email.js`
   - `src/backend/scripts/listUsers.js`

How to use / test locally:

1. From the backend folder, install new deps and start the server:

```powershell
cd src/backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Observe JSON structured logs in the console. For prettier local output add `pino-pretty` or pipe the logs through a local pretty-printer.

Commit & branch:

- Changes were committed on a feature branch named `feature/Story-5.2-Implement Structured-Logging` and pushed to the main remote.

If you want me to also add log forwarding (to e.g. Logstash/CloudWatch) or configure environment-specific formats (pretty vs json), I can add that as a follow-up.
